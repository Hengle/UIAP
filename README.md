UIAP
===========

## What is this? ##
After we developing the game by Unity3d, we need to add purchase model to make money. 

This project is designed to make it easy. Currently Only have App Store version. Google Play will follow this verision.

## How to install and use? ##
You can clone this repo. Then open the project in  Assets/Example. It's a demo project for purchasing.

If you want to export to IOS platform, you should follow standard operation of Unity3d.

Anyway don't forget add StoreKit.framework in Xcode Project : )

## Support Version ##

* Unity3d v4+
* IOS 6.0+

## Limitations and Future ##
As this function model is in an project.so it's not convenient to install. I will try to make it easy to install.

On the other hand, I will add ios auto export and make ipa,which make export easily.
